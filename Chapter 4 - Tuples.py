### TUPLE IS IMMUTABLE IE - IT CAN'T BE CHANGED

a = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) # TUPLE WITH MORE THAN 1 TERMS
b=() # EMPTY TUPLE
c = (1,) # TUPLE WITH ONE TERM NEEDS A COMA as without it, it will consider it as an integer

print(c)


# METHODS OF TUPLE

# print(a.count(3)) # Tells how many times an element occurs in a tuple

# print(a.index(4))
