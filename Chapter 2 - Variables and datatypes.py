# # Chapter 2 - Variables and Datatypes

# a = 1 # a is an integer
 
# b = 2

# print(a+b)

# name = "Divyam" # name is a string datatype

# fl = 10.2 # fl is a float

# bo = True # bo is boolean variable

# e = None # e is a none type variable

# # Variable name can't start with any number, digit or any special symbol however it can start from an underscore

# #The variable name can't contain any special character and cannot have whitespaces



# Typecasting

# a = str(31) # This will mark 31 as a string
# print(type(a))

# b = float(21) # This will make 21 a float
# print(b, type(b)) 

# c = "31.2"
# print(float(c)) # This will change 31.2 to float





# INPUT function

# a = int(input("Enter a number: ")) # This will take the number as an integer
# print(a, type(a))

# b = float(input('Enter number 2: '))
# print(b, type(b))

# c = str(input("Enter a number: "))
# print(c, type(c))
